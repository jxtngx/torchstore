# Under Construction!

Nothing to see here yet, but check back soon


# Contributing Guidelines

1. Build in public -- TorchStore should be OSS first, giving users a clear vision on where we want to go and how to help us get there.

2. Build the Bicycle, not the super car -- Develop value iterively, instead of trying to ship everything at once.

3. Work backwards from use cases, and leave tests!
